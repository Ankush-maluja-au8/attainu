  <h1>What are Pokémon?</h1>
<em><p>Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside humans. For the most part, Pokémon do not speak except to utter their names. There are currently more than 700 creatures that inhabit the Pokémon universe.</p>

<P>Pokémon are raised and commanded by their owners (called “Trainers”). During their adventures, Pokémon grow, level up and become more experienced and even, on occasion, evolve into stronger Pokémon.</p>

<p>There are over a dozen different types of Pokémon, such as Fire type, Psychic type, and Dragon type. Every Pokémon type comes with both advantages as well as disadvantages when battling different Pokémon types.</p>

For instance, a Fire type Pokémon has the edge against Grass type Pokémon, but will be at a disadvantage against Water type Pokémon. This makes strategic thinking, positioning and use of the Pokémon in your team a crucial part of battles.<br><br><br></em>
<strong>Here are some examples of Pokémon, highlighting how different Pokémon can look from each other</p></strong>
